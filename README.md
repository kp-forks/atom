## ‚ú® Meet Your Atom Agent

Atom is your conversational AI agent that automates complex workflows through natural language chat. Instead of manual setup, just describe what you want to automate and Atom builds complete workflows across 33+ integrated platforms (verified: 33 services registered). The chat interface serves as your automation designer, where simple conversation creates sophisticated multi-step automations.

**Ground Truth Assessment**: Based on systematic testing, 6 out of 8 core marketing claims are validated. The platform has a solid foundation with 33 service integrations registered, natural language workflow generation (100% success rate), and a complete BYOK system. Currently, Slack and Google Calendar integrations are actively working, with additional services requiring OAuth setup. **Workflow Automation UI and Scheduling UI are fully implemented and verified.**
