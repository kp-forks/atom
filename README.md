## Example Use Cases
Tired of juggling multiple apps and struggling to stay organized? Atom is here to help you reclaim your focus and boost your productivity. Here are a few ways Atom can simplify your work and personal life:

*   **Effortless Meeting Coordination:** "Find a time next week for a 30-minute meeting with Sarah and John, prioritizing Wednesday afternoon." Atom will check everyone's availability (integrating with their calendars if permitted) and propose optimal times.
*   **Smart Task Management (Voice-Powered):** Use natural voice commands like "Atom, create a task: follow up with marketing by Friday" or "Atom, what are my tasks for today?" Atom manages these tasks in a dedicated Notion database you configure.
*   **Automated Information Gathering:** "Research the latest trends in AI-powered personal assistants and summarize the key findings in a Notion document." Atom's research agents can browse, collect, and synthesize information, delivering it directly to your knowledge base.
*   **Voice-Powered Note-Taking:** While commuting, you can say: "Atom, take an audio note: Idea for marketing campaign - focus on social media engagement and influencer collaborations." Atom will transcribe the audio and save it to Notion.
*   **Automated Meeting Summaries & Action Items:** Atom can process your meeting transcripts (e.g., from live meeting attendance or uploaded recordings) and then automatically extract key decisions and action items directly into your Notion meeting notes.
*   **Intelligent Information Retrieval:** Ask Atom "What did we decide about Project X?" or "Search my meetings for discussions on marketing strategy." Atom can semantically search through your transcribed meeting archives (stored in Notion & LanceDB) to find relevant information quickly.
*   **Proactive Schedule Optimization:** With Autopilot, Atom can learn your work patterns and preferences. "My mornings are for deep work. Keep them as free of meetings as possible." Atom will then intelligently schedule new events accordingly.
*   **LLM-Powered Scheduling:** "Find a time for a 30-minute meeting with Sarah and John to discuss the Q3 marketing plan." Atom will use a large language model to parse your request and then find an optimal time for the meeting.
- **Comprehensive Finance Management:** Wake word activated finance commands via Plaid banking: "Atom what's my net worth today?" gives complete financial overview including secure bank connections, "Atom show my dining budget" displays budget analysis, "Atom where did I spend most money this month?" provides spending insights across categories, "Atom create emergency fund goal for $5000" sets up goal tracking, "Atom find Amazon purchases over $75" combines bank transactions and Gmail receipt search.
- **Quickly Access Information:** "What was the outcome of the Project Phoenix meeting last month?" Atom can search your linked Notion notes and relevant event details to provide you with the context you need.
- **Stay on Top of Your Day:** "What's on my agenda for today?" or "Do I have any free time this afternoon for a quick call?"
- **Proactive Meeting Prep:** "Atom, get me ready for my meeting with 'Project X'." Atom gathers related notes, emails, and tasks.
- **Weekly Review & Preview:** "Atom, what's my weekly digest?" Atom summarizes completed tasks, key meetings, and highlights upcoming critical items.
- **Intelligent Follow-ups:** After a meeting, ask "Atom, what follow-ups for the 'Project X' meeting?" Atom analyzes notes/transcripts for actions, decisions, and questions.
- **Banking Integration**: Complete financial management with bank account connections, budget tracking, and intelligent spending insights.
