## Example Use Cases
Tired of juggling multiple apps and struggling to stay organized? Atom is here to help you reclaim your focus and boost your productivity. Here are a few ways Atom can simplify your work and personal life:

*   **Effortless Meeting Coordination:** "Find a time next week for a 30-minute meeting with Sarah and John, prioritizing Wednesday afternoon." Atom will check everyone's availability (integrating with their calendars if permitted) and propose optimal times.
*   **Smart Task Management (Voice-Powered):** Use natural voice commands like "Atom, create a task: follow up with marketing by Friday" or "Atom, what are my tasks for today?" Atom manages these tasks in a dedicated Notion database you configure.

*   **Intelligent Information Retrieval:** Ask Atom "What did we decide about Project X?" or "Search my meetings for discussions on marketing strategy." Atom can semantically search through your transcribed meeting archives (stored in Notion & LanceDB) to find relevant information quickly.
