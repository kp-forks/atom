### 🔧 IN PROGRESS

#### Service Registry Enhancement
- ⚠️ **Service registry shows 2/33 active** (needs dynamic health checking)
- ⚠️ **Actual active services: 4/5 tested** (trello, asana, dropbox, gdrive)
- 🔧 **Health endpoints implemented** but registry logic needs update

### 🎯 NEXT PRIORITIES

#### Immediate (Next Session)
1. **Update service registry logic** to dynamically check health endpoints
2. **Add health endpoints** for remaining core services (Gmail, Outlook, Teams, Slack)
3. **Complete OAuth setup** for Notion and other OAuth-required services
4. **Test voice integration endpoints**
5. **Enhance workflow intelligence** for better service matching

#### Medium Term
6. **Activate 10+ core services** (target: 10/33)
7. **Implement comprehensive error handling**
8. **Performance optimization** and monitoring
9. **Production deployment preparation**
