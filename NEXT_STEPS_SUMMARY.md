## 🎯 MEDIUM PRIORITY ENHANCEMENTS (Week 2)

### 🧠 **NLU System Enhancement**

#### 1. Debug TypeScript NLU API
**Current Status**: NLU bridge service operational but TypeScript API failing

**Action Steps**:
1. Test TypeScript NLU endpoint:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/agent/nlu \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"message":"test workflow","userId":"test_user"}'
   ```

2. Check frontend NLU service logs for errors
3. Validate NLU agent coordination
4. Test intent recognition accuracy

**Success Criteria**: NLU API returns successful responses for workflow requests

#### 2. Enhance Workflow Intelligence
**Current Status**: Basic workflow generation working (100% success rate)

**Improvements Needed**:
- Intent-aware workflow matching
- Context-based service selection  
- Template-based workflow creation
- Multi-step request handling

**Action Steps**:
1. Test diverse workflow inputs:
   ```python
   python execute_next_steps.py --test-workflow-intelligence
   ```

2. Analyze workflow generation patterns
3. Implement improved intent recognition
4. Validate workflow accuracy with real user scenarios

**Success Criteria**: Workflows match user intent >90% of the time
