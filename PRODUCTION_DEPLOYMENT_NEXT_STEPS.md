./deploy_production.sh --frontend-only   # Frontend on port 3000
./deploy_production.sh --desktop-only    # Build desktop app
./deploy_production.sh --verify-only     # Run verification tests
```

#### 2.2 Health Check Verification
```bash
# Automated verification included in deployment

curl http://localhost:5059/api/calendar/events
curl http://localhost:5059/api/tasks
```

### 3. Frontend & Desktop Applications

#### 3.1 Frontend Application
```bash
# Frontend automatically connects to backend on port 5059
./deploy_production.sh --frontend-only

# Access at: http://localhost:3000
```

**Production Frontend**: For cloud deployment, build and deploy to Vercel/Netlify:
```bash
cd frontend-nextjs && npm run build
```

#### 3.2 Desktop Application
