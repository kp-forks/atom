## 🔧 Test Automation Architecture

### Test Environment Setup
```yaml
# docker-compose.test.yml
version: '3.8'
services:
  test-db:
    image: postgres:13-alpine
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: atom_test
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: test123
      
  test-redis:
    image: redis:7-alpine
    
  test-services:
    build: 
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.test
    depends_on:
      - test-db
      - test-redis
    environment:
      NODE_ENV: test
      DATABASE_URL: postgresql://postgres:test123@test-db:5432/atom_test
```

### Test Data Management
**Pre-production Test Data:**
- Synthetic financial data sets
- Mock integration responses
- Load testing scenarios
- Security attack vectors

**Data Privacy:**
- All test data anonymized
- No production data in test environments
- Automatic data cleanup after tests
- Secure test environment isolation
