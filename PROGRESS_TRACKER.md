## 🛠️ Next Immediate Actions

### Priority 1: API Key Acquisition
```bash
# Required API Keys to Obtain:
# 1. OpenAI API Key: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
# 2. Google OAuth Credentials: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
# 3. Notion Integration Token: https://www.notion.so/my-integrations
# 4. Dropbox App Keys: https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps
# 5. Trello API Keys: https://trello.com/power-ups/admin
# 6. Asana OAuth App: https://app.asana.com/0/developer-console
# 7. Other service credentials as needed
```

### Priority 2: Real Integration Testing

```bash
# Test with real API keys
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_openai_key
export GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_actual_google_client_id
export GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_actual_google_secret
export NOTION_API_TOKEN=your_actual_notion_token
export DROPBOX_APP_KEY=your_actual_dropbox_key
export DROPBOX_APP_SECRET=your_actual_dropbox_secret

# Run integration tests with real keys
python backend/python-api-service/test_integrations.py --env .env.production
```

### Priority 3: Production Deployment Preparation
```bash
# Test production configuration
cp .env.production.template .env.production
# Edit .env.production with real API keys

# Test with production settings
export ENV_FILE=.env.production
python backend/python-api-service/start_app.py

# Verify all integrations work
python backend/python-api-service/test_integrations.py --env .env.production --test-all
```

### Priority 4: Service-Specific Testing
```bash
# Test individual integrations
python backend/python-api-service/test_integrations.py --env .env.production --test-service openai
python backend/python-api-service/test_integrations.py --env .env.production --test-service google
python backend/python-api-service/test_integrations.py --env .env.production --test-service notion
