# Self hosted docker solution

## Build Steps

The build steps are to start a docker compose file on a local machine with Cloudflare tunnel. The unnel will allow you to sync with Google calendar.

### 1. Get Google Client Ids for Google Calendar



To get the client ID and client secret for testing Google Calendar API, you need to follow these steps:

- Go to the [Google APIs Console](^1^) and sign in with your Google account.
- Create a new project or select an existing one.
- Enable the Google Calendar API for your project.
- Click on Credentials in the left sidebar and then click on Create credentials > OAuth client ID.
- Select Web application as the application type and enter a name for your client ID.
- Specify the authorized JavaScript origins and redirect URIs for your web application. For testing purposes, you can use http://localhost or http://localhost:<port_number> as the origin and redirect URI.
- Click on Create and you will see a pop-up window with your client ID and client secret. Copy and save them somewhere safe.

You can also refer to this [guide](^3^) for more details and screenshots.

### 2. Get Cloudflared Setup on your local machine
- Refer to docs to install and run [Cloudflared](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/install-and-setup/tunnel-guide/) locally
- You will need a custom domain

### 3. For Supertokens
- Configure with Hasura
- HASURA_GRAPHQL_JWT_SECRET='{ "jwk_url": "{apiDomain}/{apiBasePath}/jwt/jwks.json"}'

### 4.Generate Certs for OpenSearch

To generate certificates for OpenSearch using OpenSSL on macOS, you can follow these steps:

- Install OpenSSL using HomebrewÂ²Â³:

```sh
brew install openssl
```

- Create a directory to store your certificates and keys:

```sh
mkdir opensearch-certs
cd opensearch-certs
```

- Generate a CA certificate and key:

```sh
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout ca.key -out ca.crt -days 365 -nodes -subj '/CN=opensearch-ca'
```

- Generate a CSR (certificate signing request) and key for each node or client that needs a certificate:

```sh
openssl req -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout node1.key -out node1.csr -nodes -subj '/CN=node1'
openssl req -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout node2.key -out node2.csr -nodes -subj '/CN=node2'
openssl req -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout client.key -out client.csr -nodes -subj '/CN=client'
```

- Generate certificates from the CSRs using the CA certificate and key:

```sh
openssl x509 -req -in node1.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out node1.crt
openssl x509 -req -in node2.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out node2.crt
openssl x509 -req -in client.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out client.crt
```

- Verify the certificates:

```sh
openssl verify -CAfile ca.crt node1.crt node2.crt client.crt
```

You should see `OK` for each certificate. Now you have your certificates and keys ready to use with OpenSearch. I hope this helps. ðŸ˜Š

### 5. Opensearch setup

1. change OPENSEARCH_USERNAME and OPENSEARCH_PASSWORD
2. generate hash using gen_hash.py
3. store values in internal_users.yml
4. Check role_mapping.yml for username provided
5. Check roles.yml for consistency

### 6. Optaplanner sync
- OPTAPLANNER_USERNAME & OPTAPLANNER_PASSWORD -> sync with add data to table sql command for admin_user table:
  - ```INSERT INTO admin_user (id, username, password, role) VALUES (1, 'admin', 'password', 'admin');```
    - Change values 2nd and 3rd position part of the ```VALUES``` statemen

### 7. Classification sync
- CLASSIFICATION_PASSWORD is SAME AS API_TOKEN and MUST BE SAME
- CLASSIFICATION_USERNAME is hard coded

### 8. Apply Hasura Metadata
- ```hasura metadata apply --endpoint "http://localhost:8080" --admin-secret "hello123"```

### 9. Start docker compose

```
cp .env.example .env
docker-compose up -d
```
