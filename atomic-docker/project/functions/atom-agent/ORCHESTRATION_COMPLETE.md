## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The Atom Agent now has a **complete orchestration system** that connects all components:

```
User Input → NLU → Orchestrator Decision → Execution Engine → Skills → Integration → Response
     ↓          ↓           ↓                 ↓              ↓          ↓
   Intent   Complexity   Route Selection   Task Chain    Skills    Consolidated
 Detection  Analysis     & Decomposition   Execution     Network   Response
```

- **Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Function**: Decomposes complex tasks into sub-tasks
- **Features**: 
  - Sequential execution with inter-task context
  - Rich error handling and comprehensive reporting
  - Context sharing between sub-tasks

### 2. **Synthesizing Agents** - `guidance_orchestrator.ts`
- **Status**: ✅ INTEGRATED
- **Function**: Multi-agent learning and guidance system
- **Integration Level**: Fully connected to main handler

### 3. **Skill Router** - Enhanced switch statements
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
- **Coverage**: 20+ individual skills connected
- **Categories**:
  - Communication (Gmail, Slack, Teams)
  - CRM (HubSpot, Notion)
  - Calendar & Scheduling
  - Web Research
  - Automation (Zapier)
  - Productivity Tools

### 4. **Context-Aware Processing**
- **Status**: ✅ ENABLED
- **Function**: Maintains state between orchestrated sub-tasks
- **Example**: Email search results inform calendar scheduling

## 🔗 Complete Skill Network

### **Connected Skills (Channels)**
```typescript
// ✅ All operational and orchestrated
const connectedSkills = {
  // Communication Stack
  email: ['search', 'read', 'send', 'manage'],
  gmail: ['search', 'extract-info', 'bulk-operations'],
  slack: ['search', 'send', 'channel-management'],
  teams: ['meetings', 'messages', 'collaboration'],
  
  // Scheduling & Calendar
  calendar: ['events', 'meetings', 'reminders', 'conflicts'],
  zoom: ['meetings', 'details', 'recordings'],
  calendly: ['event-types', 'scheduling', 'availability'],
  
  // CRM & Task Management
  hubspot: ['contacts', 'deals', 'integrations'],
  notion: ['tasks', 'databases', 'project-management'],
  
  // Research & Guidance
  webResearch: ['search', 'analysis', 'summary'],
  semanticSearch: ['cross-platform', 'contextual', 'meeting-notes'],
  guidanceAgent: ['learning', 'tutorials', 'explanations'],
  
  // Automation
  zapier: ['triggers', 'workflows', 'integrations'],
  
  // Data & Analytics
  stripe: ['payments', 'invoices', 'revenue'],
  quickbooks: ['invoices', 'accounting', 'financial-data']
};
```

## 🎯 Complex Task Examples (Now Working)

### **Multi-Step Workflow #1**
```
Input: "Search my email for Q4 reports from last week, 
read the CEO's email if found, create a Notion task to review it"

Process:
1. ✅ Search email for "Q4 reports"
2. ✅ Filter results from "CEO" 
3. ✅ Read the most relevant email
4. ✅ Create Notion task with email context
5. ✅ Return consolidated progress report
```

### **Synthesizing Agent Example**
```
Input: "Find me advanced Excel pivot table tutorials 
and schedule time to practice the techniques"

Process:
1. ✅ Guidance agent finds tutorials
2. ✅ Synthesizes learning path
3. ✅ Creates calendar task for practice
4. ✅ Links tutorial references in task
```
